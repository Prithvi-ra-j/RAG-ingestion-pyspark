Enterprise RAG System Documentation

Introduction
This document describes the Enterprise RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system built with PySpark and sentence transformers.

Key Features
- Document ingestion from multiple formats (PDF, TXT, DOCX)
- Intelligent text chunking with overlap
- Vector embeddings using sentence transformers
- Fast similarity search with FAISS
- RESTful API for querying

Architecture
The system consists of several components:
1. Ingestion pipeline for processing documents
2. Chunking service for splitting text
3. Embedding generation using CPU-optimized models
4. Vector store for similarity search
5. API service for user queries

Performance
The system is optimized for 8GB RAM environments and uses CPU-only processing for maximum compatibility.

Getting Started
1. Place documents in data/raw/
2. Run the ingestion pipeline
3. Generate embeddings
4. Build vector store
5. Start the API service
